    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Elevation: 31’</p>
	<p>Begins near Canada College, crosses I-280 at the Farm Hill Road junction, heads south and then turns southeast. Turns towards the northeast and crosses I-280 again at the SR-84 junction. Continues northeast, becomes a concrete channel at Alameda De Las Pulgas (former USGS stream gage). Confluence with Arroyo Ojo de Agua and then empties into the Bay.</p>

    <h2>NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation Frequency Estimates:</h2>

    <h2>Hydrology</h2>
    <p>
      Creek needs prolonged high-intensity rainfall in order to flood, possibly a 1/50 or 1/100 year event in the range of 60 min – 3 days. Saturated soils also lower precipitation requirement (7 – 30 day totals).

    <h3>Height:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>75” bottom of the bridge</li>
      <li>80” top of concrete barrier</li>
      <li>95” top of bridge</li>
      <li>46” from bottom to line</li>
      <li>34” from line to top</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Width:</h3>
    <p>198” or 16.5’</p>

    <h2>Flood Thresholds</h2>
    <h3>Stages:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> 5’ ~1215 cfs – Creek nearing flood stage</li>
      <li><strong>Minor:</strong> 6.7’ ~1710 cfs – Creek at flood stage, reaches front yard</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> 7.7’ – Creek reaches porch level, road level</li>
      <li><strong>Major:</strong> 10.7’ – Creek reaches front window level</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flood History</h2>
    <p>November 17, 2025: From around 12:45 A.M to 12:50 A.M, there was an observed rain rate of 2.4"/hr on my WS-2000 AWS. 0.13" was recorded from 12:40 to 12:45, 0.20" was recorded from 12:45 to 12:50, and a further 0.09" was recorded from 12:50 to 12:55. This makes for a total of 0.20" in 5 minutes, 0.33" in 10 minutes, 0.42" in 15 minutes, and 0.41" in 30 minutes. Radar showed 50–55 dBZ over my location around 12:50–12:55 A.M., consistent with ~2–3″/hr rainfall rates. Given this and typical AWS behavior during short convective bursts, it is highly likely that both my AWS and my 4″ manual gauge underestimated the true peak by a few hundredths. The intense rainfall was produced by a Narrow Cold Frontal Rainband (NCFR) embedded within a late-night atmospheric river / cold frontal passage over the Bay Area. This burst probably caused Redwood Creek to rise from just a few inches to roughly 1.5–2.5 feet within about an hour. The Redwood Creek most likely rose from a few inches to ~1.5-2.5' in under an hour after the NCFR passage. Using NOAA Atlas 14, and allowing for gauge under-catch plus the Atlas-14 confidence intervals, the estimated recurrence intervals for the observed burst are approximately: 5-minute: ~10-year, 10-minute: ~15-year, 15-minute: ~20–25-year, 30-minute: ~5-year. </p>
